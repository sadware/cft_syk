# Conformal Field Theory and the SYK Model

This repository contains the PDF of my Bachelor's project titled **Conformal Field Theory and the SYK Model**, submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the course Advanced Physics - Project Course, 1FA565 at Uppsala University.

## ðŸ“„ Abstract

This project focuses on conformal field theory and its application to the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence. On this matter, the general properties of CFTs in  $d \geq 3$ dimensions are derived and discussed. These features are then used to study the 1d SYK model, which is nearly conformal in the infrared. In particular, two-point functions, effective and Schwarzian actions are computed and used in a qualitative analysis of the four-point functions and their role in the leading-order corrections to the (out-of-)time-ordered correlation functions. The link to an incomplete AdS dual is finally made through these (O)TOCs by comparing them to those of Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity, and a comment is made on the speculated complete dual of the SYK model.
